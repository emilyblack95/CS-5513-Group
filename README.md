## Setup:
1) Download Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
2) Download VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3) CD to your desktop and run 'vagrant init'. This sets up initially where the VMs will be.
4) CD to folder ADBMS_1 and run 'vagrant up'. This will install and create your VM. To SSH in, run 'vagrant ssh'. To stop it after it starts running, run 'vagrant halt'.
5) Open up VirtualBox. You will see your VM running if you followed these instructions correctly. Double click it on the left side to open up its terminal.
